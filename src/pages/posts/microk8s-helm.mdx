I was looking around for a way to have a lightweight Kubernetes that I can run on my Mac and use it to deploy and test my hobby applications.

My experience with using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) in the past was not very pleasant primarily due to the need to install an additional hypervisor like Virtual Box.

I found the solution in [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) which allows you to quickly setup and run a lean single node Kubernetes cluster on your laptop. This coupled with the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager lets you easily deploy your applications into your Kubernetes cluster on the laptop that you can carry with you.

Following are the steps to have this setup on a Mac using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:

Install kubectl, the kubernetes cli

```
$ brew install kubernetes-cli
```

microK8s is a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package and is supported only on Linux.

This is where [multipass](https://multipass.run/) comes in handy. It can leverage the existing docker hyperkit hypervisor on mac to spin up Ubuntu instances quickly.

Install multipass:

```
$ brew cask install multipass
```

Launch an Ubuntu instance using multipass:

```
$ multipass launch --name microk8s-vm --mem 4G --disk 40G
```

Enter the VM instance

```
$ multipass shell microk8s-vm
```

Install the microk8s snap

```
$ sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

Check the status

```
$ sudo microk8s.status --wait-ready
```

Turn on the standard Kubernetes services

```
$ sudo microk8s.enable dns dashboard registry
```

Get kubeconfig from the instance

```
$ sudo microk8s.config
```

Copy the output to ~/.kube/config file on your mac so that kubectl uses that as the default configuration

View the cluster info from your laptop

```
$ kubectl cluster-info 

Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.64.3:16443 
Heapster is running at https://192.168.64.3:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
...
```

You now have kubectl pointing to the microk8s single node kubernetes cluster running on your laptop and are setup to deploy applications on it.

Letâ€™s install nginx webserver that is hosted as a helm chart in a bitnami repo.

Install Helm on mac

```
$ brew install helm
```

Add the bitnami repo

```
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

Install nginx

```
$ helm install mywebserver bitnami/nginx
```

Verify nginx service is running in your kubernetes cluster

```
$ kubectl get svc mywebserver-nginx 

NAME               CLUSTER-IP       PORT(S) 
mywebserver-nginx  10.152.183.186   80:31743/TCP,443:32001/TCP
```

From your web browser, browse to [http://<node-ip&gt](http://<node-ip&gt);:port

e.g, <http://192.168.64.3:31743>, you should see the following nginx Welcome page

Congratulations! You deployed nginx in your microk8s kubernetes cluster on a laptop using the Helm package manager and can have it on the go with you!
